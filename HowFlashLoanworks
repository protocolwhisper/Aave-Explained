Interfaces

So if u inheritance an interface yes or yes u will need to 
put all the functions otherwise it will be abstract.

All functions declared inside an interface are implicitly virtual. They are virtual by default 
event if they do not include the virtual keyword in ther definition inside the interface.

import interface1 
import interface2

contract interface3 {
	function setter returns(interface2)
}


How do Flash Loans Works?

Write a smart contract that has a transaction that uses a flash loan.
Let's assume the function is createFlashLoan.

Your contracts calls a function on a Flash Loan provider , like Aave , indicating which
asset you want and how much of it.

The flash loan provider sends the assets to your contracts and calls back into your contract for a different function executeOperation.

executeOPeration is all custom code you must have written, u do here whatever you think u have to do will the money and then you approve back the FlashLoan provider yo withdraw bacj the borrowed assets , along with a fee.

The flash Loan provider takes back the assets it gave you , along with the premium.
